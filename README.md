This repo is for my c++ based mini projects

1. Snake game: a simple snake game using linux terminal.
    Used the ncurses library for a better UI design specially customized to the linux terminal.
    To run the game: 
    1. sudo apt-get update 
    2. sudo apt-get upgrade
    3. sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev
    4. download the snake.cpp file and open the directory.
    5. compile the code: g++ snake.cpp -o snake -lncurses
    6. run: ./snake
